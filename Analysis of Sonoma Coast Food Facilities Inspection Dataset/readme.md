Food Facility Inspection Analysis

The Food Facility Inspections Project involves the analysis of food inspection data from the Sonoma County Department of Health Services, Austin, New York and Chicago Dataset.

Understing the layout of tables, fields, and the relationships between different data elements. It helped us in understanding how the data is organized

Used Alteryx, to examine the dataset and document any identified issues, including but not limited to missing data, data discrepancies, and inconsistencies.

Implemented Datamart for the Dataset by modeling data, managing Datamart on Azure Data Studio, performing ELT on datamart by using Talend ETL.
